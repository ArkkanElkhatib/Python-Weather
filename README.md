"# Python-Weather" 

This python program uses your IP addresses to determine your latitude and longitude.  

Using this info, the program can make an API request to 'emtaweather' to get a corresponding 
'woeid' to the neatest city in the database in order to gather a weather report for the current day
and the next.
